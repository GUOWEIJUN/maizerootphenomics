# maizerootphenomics
This study dissects the genetic architecture of maize RSA, identifying significant root trait differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate lines. Using GWAS, 3,511 genes were linked to root morphology, weight, and slice traits. The candidate gene FUT5 was validated for its role in root development and heat tolerance.
